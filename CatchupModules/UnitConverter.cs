/*
ASSIGNMENT 1 — Menu-Driven Unit Converter

OBJECTIVE:
Create a console-based unit conversion program that reinforces:
- while loops
- if / else or switch statements
- methods
- numeric input validation
- formatted output

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS:
1. Display a menu repeatedly until the user chooses to exit.
2. Menu options must include:
   1) Celsius to Fahrenheit
   2) Fahrenheit to Celsius
   3) Miles to Kilometers
   4) Kilometers to Miles
   5) Exit
3. The program must validate:
   - Menu choice (must be between 1 and 5)
   - Numeric input (must be a valid double)
4. Display results formatted to two decimal places.
5. After each conversion, return to the menu.

METHOD REQUIREMENTS:
- One method per conversion
- One method to safely read a double from the user
- One method to read and validate menu choice

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not use arrays or collections
- Use Console.ReadLine() and parsing methods only

BONUS:
- Allow the user to perform multiple conversions without restarting the program
