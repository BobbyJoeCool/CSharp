ASSIGNMENT 3 — Number Analysis Tool

OBJECTIVE:
Create a program that analyzes a user-entered integer, reinforcing:
- loops
- conditional logic
- mathematical operators
- methods

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS:
1. Prompt the user to enter a positive integer.
2. Validate that the input is greater than zero.
3. Display:
   - Whether the number is even or odd
   - The sum of its digits
   - The number reversed
   - Whether the number is a palindrome
4. Allow the user to analyze multiple numbers.

METHOD REQUIREMENTS:
- A method to determine even or odd
- A method to calculate the sum of digits
- A method to reverse the number
- A method to check for palindrome

CONSTRAINTS:
- Use loops to process digits
- No strings for digit extraction (math operators only)

BONUS:
- Display the number of digits in the integer
