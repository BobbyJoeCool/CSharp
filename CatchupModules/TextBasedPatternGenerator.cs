/*
ASSIGNMENT 5 — Text-Based Pattern Generator

OBJECTIVE:
Use nested loops and conditional logic to generate patterns,
reinforcing:
- nested loops
- formatting
- method reuse

PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS:
1. Display a menu allowing the user to select:
   1) Right-aligned triangle
   2) Centered pyramid
   3) Inverted pyramid
   4) Exit
2. Prompt the user for the height of the pattern.
3. Validate the height (must be between 1 and 20).
4. Generate the selected pattern using characters such as *, #, or @.
5. Repeat until the user chooses Exit.

METHOD REQUIREMENTS:
- One method per pattern
- One method for input validation
- One method for menu display

CONSTRAINTS:
- Must use nested loops
- No string repetition shortcuts

BONUS:
- Allow the user to choose the character used in the pattern
