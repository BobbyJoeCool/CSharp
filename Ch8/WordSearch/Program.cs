/*
ASSIGNMENT 3 (Moderate) — Word Search Pattern Checker (2D char array)

BACKGROUND:
In a word-search puzzle, a word can appear horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

GOAL:
Write a C# program that:
1) Prompts for rows r and cols c.
2) Reads an r x c grid of uppercase letters (A-Z).
3) Prompts the user for a WORD (uppercase).
4) Finds ALL starting positions where the word appears in ANY of these 8 directions:
   N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW
5) Prints every match:
   - start (row, col)
   - direction name (e.g., "SE")
6) If no matches, print "No matches found."

INPUT EXAMPLE:
Grid:
C A T X
A T A T
T A C A
X T A C
Word: CAT

OUTPUT EXAMPLE:
Found at (0,0) direction=E
Found at (0,0) direction=S
Found at (2,2) direction=W
...

REQUIREMENTS:
- Use char[,] grid.
- Must check bounds carefully.
- Use nested loops + direction loops.
- No hardcoding word length or grid size.
